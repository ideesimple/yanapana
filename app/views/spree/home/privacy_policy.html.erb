Although most changes may occur immediately, information may still be stored in a web browser’s cache.

<p>YANAPANA may post links to third party websites on its Site.  These third party websites are not screened for privacy or security issues by YANAPANA, and you release us from any liability for the conduct of these third party websites.</p>

<p>Please be aware that this Privacy Policy, and any other policies in place, in addition to any amendments, does not create rights enforceable by third parties or require disclosure of any personal information relating to members of the Service or Site.

Please review the privacy policy and terms of service for each site you visit through third party links.</p>

<h3>8.  Third Party Access to Your Information</h3>

<p>You can rest assured that your personal information will never be sold, shared or rented. Of course while you are entering into an Agreement with YANAPANA to disclose your information to us, in order for us to complete the business cycle, we need to participate with third party contractors and webhosts such as PayPal (fully encrypted) to process payments and carriers such as USPS, UPS and FedEx to get the products to you. In addition, we work with tools such as Google Analytics, Google Webmaster SEO Tools, Jotforms.com and Spree Commerce Metrics to enhance, collect and provide our business to clients.  As such, these third party organizations will inherently have to access your information.</p>

<p>It is therefore necessary that you grant the third parties we may use in the course of our business the same rights that you afford us under this Privacy Policy.  For this reason, you hereby agree that for every authorization which you grant to us in this Privacy Policy, you also grant to any third party that we may hire, contract, or otherwise retain the services of for the purpose of operating, maintaining, repairing, or otherwise improving or preserving our website or its underlying files or systems.  You agree not to hold us liable for the actions of any of these third parties, even if we would normally be held vicariously liable for their actions, and that you must take legal action against them directly should they commit any tort or other actionable wrong against you.</p>

<h3>9.  Release of Your Information for Legal Purposes</h3>

<p>At times it may become necessary, for legal purposes, to release your information in response to a request from a government agency or a private litigant.  You agree that we may disclose your information to a third party where we believe, in good faith, that it is desirable to do so for the purposes of a civil action, criminal investigation, or other legal matter.  In the event that we receive a subpoena affecting your privacy, we may elect to notify you to give you an opportunity to file a motion to quash the subpoena, or we may attempt to quash it ourselves, but we are not obligated to do either.  We may also proactively report you, and release your information to, third parties where we believe that it is prudent to do so for legal reasons, such as our belief that you have engaged in fraudulent activities.  You release us from any damages that may arise from or relate to the release of your information to a request from law enforcement agencies or private litigants.</p>

<h3>10.  Commercial and Non-Commercial Communications</h3>

<p>By providing information to the Site that forms the basis of communication with you, such as contact information, you waive all rights to file complaints concerning unsolicited email from YANAPANA since, by providing such information, you agree to receive communication from us or anyone else covered under this Privacy Policy.  However, you may unsubscribe from certain communications by notifying YANAPANA that you no longer wish to receive solicitations or information and we will endeavor to remove you from the database.</p>
